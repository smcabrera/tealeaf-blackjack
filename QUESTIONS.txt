Here are some questions I have for a TA

I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of protected versus private methods.

1.  For instance for this couple of methods I wrote as part of my card class, it worked fine whether I made them private or protected.
    What exactly would I be able to do with they're being protected that I wouldn't be able to do with them as private?
    (At least the way that I've written it).

2.  I'm also having trouble with when to use @attrname versus when to use self.attrname versus when I can just get away with calling the name of the
    variable by itself (I guess that would be "when can I call the method with the same name")

3.  I have this module that I've include to determine some booleans about various game states. I do wonder if this is maybe more
    code than necessary, but I did think it helped make my Blackjack class a little bit smaller extracting some of the logic
    about different things that can be true about hands. However one question I had relates to my code not seeming to be very DRY; I
    have basically the same methods doing things for players and for dealers "dealer_blackjack" and "player_blackjack" etc. What would
    be the best way to clean that up?
